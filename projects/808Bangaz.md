<h1> 808 Bangaz Fourm Posting Website</h1>

This project was conducted in EE491F Data Driven Web Development in the summer of 2022.
My team members were tasked in making a website that utulizes CURD techniques and that is accessible on the internet.

My team members and I were inspired to make a fourm posting website because of Reddit. Reddit is a network of communites where people can talk
about their hobbies, interests, and passion. Reddit basically almosts has a community for anything, wether it be sharing dog/cat videos, college advice, work advice, or even politics.

My responsibilities with in the project were to create a working NavBar, like/dislike system, and the whole website layout.
Below is a video explaing all the features within the website.
