  <h2> The start of something new, it feels so right to be a software engineer </h2>
<p><br />
After high school I did not expect myself to be so interested in software engineering. At the start of my college career I wanted to become an electrical engineer. I was always so fascinated by circuit design and was inspired by my father who himself is an electrical engineer. My interests shifted around my sophomore year of college. I was browsing youtube and came across a youtuber named Michael Reeves. Michael Reeves made videos relating to software engineering and programming, creating fun and entertaining projects. Such projects as “Hacking Drones with a children toy”, “Scream Powered Microwave”, and my favorite “Using a hacked bop it to fix Hawaii’s Missile System”. His videos showed me how fun and interesting software engineering could be and I made the switch to become a computer engineer at the start of the next semester.

<h2> My current interests in Software Engineering </h2>
<p>As of right now I am really interested in building and designing websites. During the summer I took a web design course and honestly I had a blast doing all the projects and homeworks, I would spend an embracing amount of time on some of them just to have fun. Currently I am interested in becoming a front end web developer because that was what I found most the fun.</p>

<p>By the end of the semester I hope to expand and improve my current skill set. These improvements will aid me in my journey to become a front end web developer. I look forward to the rest of this class as I hope this will be a good and fun experience.</p>
