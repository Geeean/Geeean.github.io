  <p>Prior to this class I have worked a little bit with JavaScript (JS). During summer I took a web development course where we had to use a little bit of JS to make the website more intractable, but I have not been using JS since then. Almost this whole JS exercise was a learning experience, because back when I made the website I just wrote code without understanding too much about how it worked. An example of this would be the difference between var, let, and const and when to use them. var is used to declare variables, the problem with var is that it lets the variable be redefined anywhere in the program. Unless you want the variable to be redefined it could pose a problem if you are unaware that it is already defined in your code then it could cause a lot of bugs. let is similar to var where it is used to declare variables, but let is often seen as a better choice than var. One of the reasons is that variables defined by using let cannot be redefined within the same scope, but it can be updated though. Lastly there is const, const also is used to create a variable, but that variable cannot be updated or redeclared. Before this I would assign every variable with var.</p>

<h2> My current thoughts on WODs and Athletic Software Engineering </h2>

<p>I find the practice WODs and athletic software engineering useful, since it does in a way emulate a coding interview and forces students to be fast and efficient problem solvers in order to solve the problem within a reasonable time frame. Though I do think the in-class WODs are useful, in my opinion I do not like this style of learning since it provocs a lot of stress having to complete a the task in a timely matter because I like to take my time when solving problems, but I do see it as an essential way to improve yourself.</p>

<h2> Is Javascript even good? </h2>
<p>Is JS a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective? Like I said in the beginning, all programming languages have their own pros and cons that come with using the language. To quote the creator of C++ <i>Bjarne Stroustrup “There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.”</i> JS is one of the most popular languages out there, so I do think JS is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective, especially in web development. If you ever want to go into web development I believe that it is essential to learn and understand how to use JS. JS is a powerful tool that makes websites more interactive and user friendly.</p>
