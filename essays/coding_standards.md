<h3> What exacly are coding standards </h3>
Coding standards are like a set of rules, techniques, and practicies to creater cleaner and more readable code. This standard allows software engineers to build and maintain highly functional code. Everyone has their own way of writing code so that means each industry has their own specific coding standards, but there are universal standards that all must follow.


<h4> Focus on code readability </h4>
Readable code has got to be one of the most imporant standards, because if your code isn't readable then no one is going to understand what your trying to do. Inorder to have readable code you must do some of the following:
<br>
<ol>
    <li> Write as few lines as possible. </li>
    <li> Use appropiate naming conventions. </li>
    <li> Use indentation to make the begging and end of control structures. </li>
</ol>
<br>

<h4> Standardize headers for different modules </h4>

<br>
It makes it easier to understand and maintain code headers of different files, each header should have:
<br>
<ol>
    <li>program name</li>
    <li>Creation Date</li>
    <li>Name of author</li>
    <li>Modification History</li>
    <li>Summary of what the program does</li>
    <li>functions in the program</li>
    <li>variables used by the functions</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h4> Don't use the same variable for multiple purposes </h4>
Each variable should have a meaningful name and description indicating the reason why we are using it. Reusing the same variable for different purposes can often confuse the reader and overall makes improving or maintaining the program much more difficult
<br>

<h4> Leave comments and prioritize documentation </h4>
Leaving comments and documenting your processes is very important especially in software development. Just because the person reading your code is a software developer doesn't mean they will understand what your trying to do. Like everyone else they are also human, so that means it makes their lives much easier if you were to describe what each function does and what each variable is used for. Instead of them trying to figure out and maybe do the complete opposite of what you want them to do.
<br>

<h3> Food for Thought </h3>
When I started my journey as a programmer, like everyone I had poor coding standards. I would just name functions and variables with just any ole name and no comments within sight, just so long as I got the assigment completed and working properly. But over time as I worked in groups and as the professors and TA's gotten stricter I have noticed the way I write code is down right awful. Theres a reason why we have coding standards, its basically a way to make everyone life much easier, not just you but the people who you work with especially.
<br>
Looking through the list of universal coding standards, I can safely say that I do follow most of these coding standards. But I do miss some, especially the last one writing comments and documenting. This normally protains to coding assigments since they are usually solo work, when your working on a long assigment with less than ten minutes left on the deadline at this point you just want to turn in the work as soon as possible and enjoy the rest of your day. But there are no excuses! and I will work on breaking that habit.

<h3> Thoughts on ESLint with IntelliJ </h3>
So far this past week I've been using ESLint with IntelliJ and I do have to say that it is pretty painful to use, but it is extremely useful since it is able to catch all my bad habits while coding. Its definitely going to take time to get used to ESLint, but when I do get used to I know for sure that means I have improved as a programmer and a software engineer. I defenitely believe that some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Writing comments within your code especially when learning a new language can help you get used to the syntax and get you comfortable with writing code.
