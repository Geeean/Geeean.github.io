<h2> What is UI Frameworks?</h2>

<p> 
UI stands for User Interface, a UI Framework is a tool for building software programs such to run on the internet,
</p>


<h2> Why use UI Frameworks such as bootstrap 5? </h2>
        
From my personal experience making websites with just raw HTML and CSS is actually a huge pain in the ass. Using a framework such as Bootstrap 5 gets the job done quick and cleaner. Bootstrap 5 adds so many classes that just formats the columns, rows, and containers in such a way where it does not clutter your stylesheet.css.

The picture on the left is a website made with bootstrap while the picture on the right shows a website made with just purely HTML and CSS. Both websites look good on their own rights, but the website made with just purely HTML and CSS probably had more time sunk into it. This is because they had make their own styling classes just for the spacing and organization. So theres a good chance their stylesheet is just cluttered with stuff like that. Looking at bootstrap website we can clearly see how clean the website looks. All the extra classes and files that come with bootstrap really makes a difference design wise.
