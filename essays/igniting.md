Questions are an essential part of learning and understanding how the world works. In a perfect world where everyone understands everything and everyone around them, then questions wouldnâ€™t be as important as they are now, but we do not live in such a world. As software engineers we immerse ourselves in a world of ever changing technology and it is our job to keep up or get ahead  with current trends. Asking smart questions is one of the best ways to keep up to date with current events and the latest trends.

## Now how do I write smart questions? 

In order to write smart questions, you must know the following.
  1. Understand your problem.
    * if you don't know your problem, then how can you ask for proper help?
  2. Have a clear title
    * The first thing people will see is the title. if the title itself is confusing then no one will ever consider looking at your post.
  3. Ask Specific Questions
    * thats how you're going to get specific answers!
  4. Explain your problem clearly and what you've already tried
    * its good to have everyone on the same page
    * if you let them know, then you won't get answers you already tried
  5. if your question is about code, include the written code within the post, no picture!
    * no one is going to help you if you are just going to put pictures of your code. it will make their life easier if they could just copy and paste it
