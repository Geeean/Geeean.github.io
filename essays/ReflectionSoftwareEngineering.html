  <h2> Self actualization </h2>
<p>As the semester comes to a close, I have come to realize there is more to software engineering to what I have originally thought of. When I came into this course, I thought software engineering would just be about building websites/apps, but it is actually soo much more than that. There are so many different topics within the concept of software engineering. Over the span of this course I have written seven essays, including this one, about software engineering.</p>

<p>In this essay I will be discussing the following fundamental topics within software engineer:</p>

<li> Open Source Software Development </li>
<li> Development Environments </li>
<li> Ethics in Software Engineering</li>

<h2> Open Source Software Development</h2>
<p>Open source software is software with a source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Open Source is fundamentally the best part of software development in my opinion, just because its the idea that people from all over the world can come together and solve problems. This really speaks to me in a sense that, no matter how big or small that problem can be, there usually is someone who is always willing to help out. Without open source we would not have stuff like the Linux OS, Android OS, and Docker.</p>

<h2> Development Environments </h2>
<p>A development environment in terms of software engineering is a workspace with a set of processes and programming tools that are used to develop source code for an application or software product. Think of it as some sort of testing ground because it allows developers to create and innovate without breaking something in an live environment.</p>

<p>Before coming into this class I was only familiar with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) which are software that puts all the development tools into a single GUI (Graphical User Interface). In terms of web development we use both IDEs and DEs, IDEs in a sense that we use IntelliJ to write and edit our code. DEs in a sense where we used test servers to identify and fix errors that amy affect the applications workflow and user experience, in other words just to bug fix. We also used production server live environments where users can use the application while the developers can still add new features and bugfix.</p>

<h2> Ethics in Software Engineering </h2>
<p>If I said that open source software development is fundamentally the best part of software development, then Ethics in Software Engineering the most critical and important concept that software engineer must understand before going into the job field. Ethics are what divide the actual humans from the robots, as humans I feel like we have an obligation to use our skills to better our community and our way of life. Ethics provide us a way to see from what is right and what is wrong. For example is it right to work for a company like Lockheed Martin where your tasked on developing a tracking software for missiles? Realizing that your work is used to kill other humans, there are usually two sides to this type of question. Some are okay with this, others on the other-hand could not fathom doing such a thing.</p>
